        If you would like to become an official member of KASA, you must purchase
        a membership card. Most students purchase their KASA membership cards at
        the start of the year at Initiation or the Gajok G-Body meeting. However,
        if you can't make these events then please message the Cornell KASA
        Facebook page indicating your interest in becoming a member, and an
        E-Board member will deliver a membership card to you.
